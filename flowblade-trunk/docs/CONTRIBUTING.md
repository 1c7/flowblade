# Contributing to Flowblade

Contributions are a boost that all projects need.

Projects need contributions to gain a sense of being impactful and to gain added momentum towards their goals.

In this projects maintainers view these goals bring about a better world by enabling individuals to control the digital platforms that are essential in the modern world, and also by giving access to useful tooling for all people.

We really are making a difference.

# Code contributions

Flowblade is Python application so to get going you will need to have some experience in working in that language.

On the other hand, there are many tasks that could maybe taken on at let's say beginner+ level of competence and a solid medium level will very likely be adequate to handle all possible tasks. 

Flowblade is a large and complex enough codebase that the main problem with contributing to it is to get know how the codebase works. We have a document to help with getting to know the inner workings [here.](../flowblade-trunk/docs/codebaseoverview/CodebaseOverview.md)
