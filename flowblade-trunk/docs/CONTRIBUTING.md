# Contributing to Flowblade



# Code contributions

**Reqiured skills** Flowblade is Python application so to get going you will need to have some experience in working in that language.
 * There are many tasks that could maybe taken on at let's say beginner+ level of competence
 * Solid medium level will very likely be adequate to handle most if not all tasks.
 * You need be able to work with **git** and create pull requests using Github's features for doing this

**How to get started** Flowblade is a large and complex enough codebase that the main problem with contributing to it is to get know how the codebase works. 
* We have a document to help with getting to know the inner workings [here.](codeoverview/CodebaseOverview.md)
* Most contributions related communications in Flowblade project are made in comments in different items on *Issues* list


### Work with Issues list to get going
* **Your own ideas** 
   * Best way to get started is to open a new Issue, describe the feature you want to create and mention that you are planning to do the coding yourself. 
   * We will give feedback and pointers on how ahcieve the change.
* **'In Feature Queue' Issues**
   * There could be at any time be work going on with these
   * if you are interested in working on an Issue with this label drop a comment indicationg so and we will give information on what is going on.
* **'Contributions hoped' Issues**
   * Issues marked with this label are currently not planned to be worked on by project maintainer 
   * They could marked with this label for the very reason that someone else is planning to work these features. 
   * Read the comments to see if anyone is planning on working on these. if not, and you would like to, drop a comment telling that something could be coming from your direction.
* **'Bug' issues**
   * There could be at any time be work going on with these
   * If you would be interested in working on an Issue with this label drop a comment indicating so.
