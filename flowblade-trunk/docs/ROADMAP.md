# Road map
This document gives a broad overview what's happening next in Flowblade development. For more information see open Issues on the Issues tab.

## Next release (1.0)
**Local help files** Google Code is going offline at the end of the year and the Reference Guide can no longer be hosted there.
**Playback speed display for JKL scrubbing** 
**Bugfixes** The main focus of 1.0m release is stabil√∂ity, so no new features are added.

### GTK3+ port
This will be done immediately after 1.0 release. Completed between May - September 2015, depending on difficulty of task.

### Webpage
 The content for this mostly aleady exists. This will be done at the same time as the GTK3+ port and will probably be complete before  September 2015.

### Coming features in the next few releases
**Keyframe editing on the timeline** This is mainly provided for the purpose of audio mixing witch is done more naturally on the timeline. Other parameter may later be also made editable on the timeline.
**Audio Levels display enhancement** This still needs to improved.
**Audio Scrubbing** This will make editing audio on the timeline easier.
**Compositioning and masking tool** A dedicated tool to masking and simple compositioning will be provided instead of making the timeline editing more complex by adding these features as part of the main workflow.
**Single filter resizing** This is a freaquenty asked feature.
**Trimming with arrow keys** In many cases this will be more a precise and relaxed way of choosing in and out frmes for trims.
**Slowmotion forward playback for JKL scrubbing** This needs special cases to work for technical reasons and because of that has not been added so far.
